# Race AI üèéÔ∏è

A TypeScript React application featuring a grid-based race track editor and manual driving game. Create custom tracks and race through them!

## Features

### Track Editor
- **Grid-based map editor** using HTML Canvas
- **Left click** to draw roads
- **Right click** to erase and create walls
- **START and FINISH** position placement buttons
- **Save maps as JSON** with grid, start, and finish data

### Racing Game
- **Car rendering** with small rectangle/triangle visualization
- **Arrow key controls**:
  - Up: Accelerate
  - Left/Right: Turn
  - Down: Brake
- **Collision detection** - "Crashed!" message when hitting walls
- **Finish line detection** - "Finished!" message when crossing the finish
- Car spawns at the START position

### Interface
- **Mode switching** between Editor and Play modes
- **Clean UI** styled with Tailwind CSS
- Map data seamlessly passed from Editor to Game

## Tech Stack

- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **HTML Canvas** for grid-based rendering
- **Create React App** for build tooling
